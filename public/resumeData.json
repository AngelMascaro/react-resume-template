    "bio":"I am extrovert and sociable. I love to work in group and share knowledge with anyone around me. It makes me grow at an extraordinary speed. I try to be fit doing sport, I play Football in a Football 7 league in Girona and I like too much Padel. My winter sport is SnowBoard. I had not enough time to read but I like it. I invest my time at home reading programming manuals about technologies which I am interested or deploying new small functionalities to make my live easier. With me there is always dynamism, I am a person with a sense of humor who does not hesitate to take responsibility when the occasion requires it.",
